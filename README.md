## About

This project is a combination of my love of programming and all things witchy and magical.

For any given moment, the app displays:
- The current moon phase, along with the date and time
- A brief description of the themes of the current phase
- A few suggestions for activities that go along with the themes of the current phase
- Both the previous and next major moon phases, along with the zodiac sign the moon was in and will be in (a new moon or full moon is considered a 'major moon phase' here)

The current moon phase is calculated using a simple formula by [Ben Daglish](http://www.ben-daglish.net/moon.shtml). It takes the difference between the current date and a known new moon date (January 7, 1970) for a value between 1 and 30. Each moon phase is associated with a numerical range.

The major moon phases, specifically the associated zodiac signs, were a little more complicated. As it turns out, astrology calculations are very complex! I couldn't find an API that fit my needs and stayed within the scope of my ability and this project, so I ended up compiling a few years' worth of moon phase data into a JSON file.

In the near future, I plan to update the project with:
- [ ] Code cleanup and optimization
- [ ] Basic animations and hover states
- [ ] A few simple unit tests
